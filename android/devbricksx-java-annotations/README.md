# Devbricks X Java Annotations

This library provides a set of annotations which simplify the developement with [Android Room Library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room). It helps you to generate core elements which are required byAndroid Room Library. Basically, you can save around 100 lines of code per entity class.

## Installation
To use annotation and its compiler, add the following dependencies in build.gradle of your application.

#### Jcenter

```groovy
repositories { 
	jcenter()
}
```

#### Dependencies

```groovy
dependencies {
 	implementation "com.dailystudio:devbricksx-java-annotations:$devbricksx_version"

 	kapt "com.dailystudio:devbricksx-java-compiler:$devbricksx_version"
 	kapt "androidx.room:room-compiler:2.2.5"
}
```

#### Latest version

```groovy
devbricksx_version = "0.6.0"
```

The codes generated by this library require Android Room Library to compile. DO NOT forget to include **room-compiler** in dependencies.
